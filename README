This is Drop-in menu bar.

There are only five files you need. 
Download the tarball, drag the LightMenuBar folder into your project. 
The LightMenuBar is subclass of UIView and I am sure you know how to deal with it. 
Implement the three required methods in the LightMenuBarDelegate and you have this menu bar in your App!!

Please refer to the Wiki for Sample Code.
